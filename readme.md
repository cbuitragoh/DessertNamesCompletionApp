## Dessert Suggestions app

<pre>
This app is a fast implementation of completion 
and generate images using models from
HuggingFace and OpenAI.

The openAI models show best performance.

To use OpenAI models is necessary to use your
personal OPENAI_API_KEY

The app gives names of desserts according to 
the product (fruit or type of dessert) proposed.

Then, if the user wants to create an image of 
one of the suggested desserts, they can do so 
with a request to Dalle-3 and download it if 
they wish.

Nota. The HuggingFace model selected for this 
application is very basic compared to the OpenAI 
models.
